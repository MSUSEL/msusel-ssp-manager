bandit_output_test.json 


fileAndVulnerabilitiesLinesDictionaryList.txt (produced by parseBanditOutput.py)
a list of dictionaries where each key is a file and each value is a line number. 
The files have duplicates.


banditObjects.txt (produced by parseBanditOutput.py, uses bandit_output_test.json as input)
a list of  objects with trimmed content from the bandit output. 
(Excludes test files and some of the keys that bandit produces in its output)


noDuplicateFilesList.txt (produced by getFunctionNames.py, removeDuplicates f, 
uses fileAndVulnerabilitiesLinesDictionaryList.txt as input)
a list of dictionaries where the keys are files and the values are a list of the 
line numbers where the vulnerabilities occur. 
There are no duplicate keys.


filesAndFunctionNames.txt (We input noDuplicateFilesList.txt to getFunctionNamesFromSourceFiles function
 and get the function names from the source files.)
This is a list of json objects (dictionaries) whose keys are files (absolute path)
and the values are lists of function names where each name represents a vulnerable 
function in that file. (I added functionality to remove duplicates from the FUNCTION list)


profile_data.json (produced by dynamicCallGraph.py)
From the output, we want to use filename and function_name.


profile_data.txt (produced by parseProfile.py)
json objects that have key either filename or function_name


** THE FILENAME IS THE LAST KEY, NOT THE FIRST
