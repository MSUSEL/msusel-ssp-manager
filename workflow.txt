1) We need a profile


we know that we can input a profile and generate a ssp file on the shared directory.
Right now, the generation script is just importing the controls from the profile.
(check what other generation tools are importing)





2) We have to convert the file before moving it, and, after editing moving it and then converting it, and then moving it again (need to fix it)




When we move it, it will move on the host only, not on the container.
The container will not have them in the shared folder any more, however.

2) validate the ssp

3) Now we want to edit the ssp, so we have to convert it.
